# Real-time-Audio-Feature-Extraction-with-CUDA-for-Speech-Recognition

## Developed a system that utilizes CUDA to accelerate the extraction of audio features (e.g., MFCCs - Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) from live audio streams. This enables real-time speech recognition by providing pre-processed audio data to a speech-to-text model running on local hardware.
